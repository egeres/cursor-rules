description: Use when you need to complete a method with just the definition
alwaysApply: false

Sometimes I might define functions as this in the code:

def foo(dir_stuff: Path | str):
    ...

If I tell you to complete such a method, add a:

dir_stuff = Path(dir_stuff) if isinstance(dir_stuff, str) else dir_stuff
assert isinstance(dir_stuff, Path), f"Expected Path, got {type(dir_stuff)}"

The ternary if operator should handle strings, but if the user inputs something else it
shouldnt try to turn that into a Path
