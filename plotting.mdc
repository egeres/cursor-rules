When I tell you to make a function that plots something

- The function name needs to start with "plot_"
- You need to always use plotly
- The functions always need to return a go.Figure object
- the variable to return needs to be called "fig"
- Always add a fig.update_layout() that at least has template="plotly_dark"
- Ideally you should run "uv add plotly --no-sync

Here is an example of a plotting function:



import plotly.graph_objects as go

def plot_start_end_segments(
    data: list[dict[str, float]],
    start: float | None = None,
    end: float | None = None,
) -> go.Figure:
    ......

    fig = go.Figure( ...... )
    fig.update_layout(
        title="Time Segments",
        xaxis_title="Time (seconds)",
        yaxis_title="Segment",
        xaxis={"range": [start, end]},
        yaxis={"showticklabels": False},
        showlegend=False,
    )
    return fig
